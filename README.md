# LagChunkDetection
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Brief description**: When chunktick is too high, it means there is some chunk that's laggy (maybe because of redstone lag machine, or there are hundred of shulkerbox in the chunk), than it will cause the entire server to be very laggy and unplayable.This plugin will prevent that chunk to be loaded 
# How it works:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plugin will detect if there is any player inside the lag chunk, than will teleport the player back to world spawn point
